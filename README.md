# Steam Deck game

Rather than normal games which support multiple platforms, this game is reversed, because the only platform it supports is the Steam Deck.
This is possible through advanced techniques, because the game is composed exclusively of read calls to specific files to get bits stored on the Steam Deck's SSD that are unique to its operating system, firmware, and pre-installed software.
Because of this, it is impossible to even attempt to run the game on any other hardware, or even a Steam Deck with a non-SteamOS operating system installed.
